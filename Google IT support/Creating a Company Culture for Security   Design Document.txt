# Authentication:- 
Authentication can be implemented by  the creating a user account and password by using the biometrics like fingerprints, face scanner or iris scanning. 
* should use strong password, with the standard password setting guidelines

#External Website security: -
External Website security can be implemented by using  a temporary token based system, and using SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.3 over HTTP, i.e, using HTTPS. Apart from this account creation using a username/email/user id and password can be done for long term use.
* Setup firewall and configure rules accordingly.
* Implement correct access control for regular users and adminstrators
* keep a monitoring IT team in case of a problem, breach or emergency
* Make a backup solution, if website goes down due to some reason

# Internal Website security:  
Internal website security can be implemented by setting up Firewall and configuring correct inbound and outbound rules.
* Setting up access control list for users and admins
* Encrypting the website using SSL/TLS and encrypting the communication
* Using a  authentication system using user id/username/email and password
* Educating users about security and security policy 
* keep a monitoring IT team for security in case of any problems, breach or emergency
* Make a backup solution, if website goes down due to some reason

# Remote Access Solution:-
Remote Access can be implemented by using some cloud services from some reliable and secure vendor.
* Remote Virtual machines can be used
* VPN can be used for security
* encryption should be used like over SSH
* Infrastructure as a service, Platform as a service or Software as a service can be used as necessary for Remote access.

# Firewall and Basic rules recommendations: -
* Only desirable inbound connections are allowed
* Outbound rules should be configured accordingly
* New Rules should be added and updated accordingly in case of security issues or breach

# Wireless Security: -

* never disclose wifi passwords to anyone outside the organization
* report  any malicious or suspicious activity to the security or IT team

# VLAN configuration: -
* VLAN web filtering should only allow known known hosts
* Discard any unknown traffic

For authentication in laptops use strong passwords following the standard password setting guidelines,
setup Biometric like face unlock or fingerprint if available.
* Never share login or authentication passwords
* Always lock screen/shutdown laptop while going away from your laptop
* Never connect to any unknown network
* Never write down your Password anywhere 

# Application policy recommendations: -
* Used strong passwords if password based authentication is available
* Make sure to check for permissions off the application
* Always logout of account if using any unknown system
* Check for HTTPS and the padlock on url bar while visiting any website
* Make sure the application is following security guidelines and plicies  

# Security and privacy policy recommendations:-
* Users must always follow security guidelines

# Intrusion detection or prevention for systems containing customer data:  -
Intrusion detection system should be correctly configured to match with the requirements of the organization security policy.
* It should be able to detect any sort of unknown traffic
* should set up a alert based system, and depending on alert level should alert the concerned person or team 
* In case of critical alert it should alert the entire security team, IT team.

Intrusion Prevention system should be configured in such a way that so that it should be able to detect the unknown or unwanted traffic and take necessary steps
* IPS should stop the traffic if the connection is not from any of the known hosts
* IPS should drop and discard all unwanted traffic and block the traffic
