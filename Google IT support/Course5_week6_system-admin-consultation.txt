Scenario 1:

You’re doing systems administration work for Network Funtime Company. Evaluate their current IT infrastructure needs and limitations, then provide at least five process improvements and rationale behind those improvements. Write a 200-400 word process review for this consultation. Remember, there’s no right or wrong answer, but make sure to provide your reasoning.

Software Company:

Network Funtime Company is a small company that builds open-source software. The company is made up software engineers, a few designers, one person in Human Resources (HR), and a small sales team. Altogether, there are 100 employees. They recently hired you as a system administrator to come in and become their IT department.

When a new person is hired on, the HR person purchases a laptop for them to do their work. The HR representative is unfamiliar with what type of hardware is out there; if a new employee requests a laptop, the HR person will purchase the cheapest option for a laptop online. Because of this, almost everyone has a different laptop model. The company doesn’t have too much revenue to spend, so they don’t order laptops until someone gets hired at the company. This leads to a few days of wait time from when someone starts to when they can actually work on a laptop.

The company doesn’t label their computers with anything, so if a computer is missing or stolen, there’s no way to audit it. There’s no inventory system to keep track of what’s currently in the fleet.

Once a computer is purchased, the HR person hands it to the new employee to set up. Software engineers that use Linux have to find a USB drive and add their preferred distribution to the laptop. Anytime someone needs something from HR -- whether it’s office related or tech related -- they email the HR representative directly.

When a new employee gets a machine, they’re given logins to use cloud services. They get a personal orientation with HR to make sure they can login. This requires the HR person to block off a few hours for every new employee. If an employee forgets the login to their machine, they have no way to retrieve a password and they have to reimagine their machine. Employees don’t have a strict password requirement to set for their computers.

The company currently has many of their services in the cloud, such as email, word processors, spreadsheet applications, etc. They also use the application, Slack, for instant communication.

Sol:
1. I think it will be better if instead of buying a laptop for each employee the HR or the company can take use of Cloud Virtual Machine services which will be better and hand only the credentials to login and password needs to be changed on next login, as it will need only a cheap laptop or desktop  which will be only available within the company and not allowed to  be taken out, network connection and access to the cloud service. Also data will be comparatively safer than onsite backup.
When a new employee gets hired a new Virtual Machine cloud account will be created and the credentials will be passed on to the employee, in case the employee leaves the company the account will be deleted.  

2. In case of the software installation anyone can choose their Operating System, but Linux will be better choice as for open source software development linux has a lots of tools and support to offer which can be used, and the installation of the Operating Systems can be done very easily, sometimes cloud virtual services comes preinstalled with Operating systems, and needs to be configured correctly to use.

3. If a employee forgets their password their password can be reset or given to recover password, by logging in to the cloud service and next login the user must change their password.

4. All the cloud services that are used like email , word processors, spreadsheet applications, etc can still
 be used or they can  be installed it on the cloud virtual machine.

5. In case a physical machine is used it should be used only within the company and should not be taken out, and the access to the machine should be given and all machines be manged using any Active Directory Service like Windows Active Directory Service.

6. There's a better method to install software and Operating System, i.e. to automate the software installation process,  at beginning all systems will be preinstalled with Linux and all necessary basic software will be installed by using automation software.

Scenario 2:

You’re doing systems administration work for W.D. Widgets. Evaluate their current IT infrastructure needs and limitations, then provide at least five process improvements and rationale behind those improvements. Please write a 200-400 word process review for this consultation. Remember, there’s no right or wrong answer, but make sure to provide your reasoning.

Sales Company:

W.D. Widgets is a small company that sells widgets. They’re mostly made up of salespeople who work with lots of clients. You’ve taken over as the sole IT person for this company of 80-100 people.

When HR tells you to provision a machine for a new employee, you order the hardware directly from a business vendor. You keep one or two machines in stock, in case of emergency. The users receive a username that you generate for them. You then give them an orientation on how to login when they start. You currently manage all of your machines using Windows Active Directory. The company uses only Windows computers. When a new computer is provisioned, you have to install lots of sales-specific applications manually onto every machine. This takes a few hours of your time for each machine. When someone has an IT-related request, they email you directly to help them.

Almost all software is kept in-house, meaning that you’re responsible for the email server, local machine software, and instant messenger. None of the company’s services are kept on the cloud.

Customer data is stored on a single file server. When a new salesperson starts, you also map this file server onto their local machine, so that they can access it like a directory. Whoever creates a folder on this server owns that folder and everything in it. There are no backups to this critical customer data. If a user deletes something, it may be lost for everyone.

The company generates a lot of revenue and is rapidly growing. They’re expecting to hire hundreds of new employees in the next year or so, and you may not be able to scale your operations at the pace you’re working.

1. The necessary software can be installed using some automated software deployment at single go on multiple systems, or even a drive can be used which has been cloned using some disk cloning software and consists of windows Operating Systems along with all necessary software.
In case of new Software that needs to be installed it can be directly deployed by using automated cloud deployment service.

2. Switch over to cloud service and get all the necessary software and services should be installed.
 it will be more secure and also workload will become less as cloud service will be maintained by service providers.

3. Create a new database server and stored customer data on it in case of increase customer more nodes or multiple file servers and Database Server can  be used, and whenever needed data can be mapped or transferred to the local machine, or give a read access to the Database Server.
Along with this there should be a combination of physical backup server and Cloud Backup connected to the Database Server, multiple backup servers in case of more data needs and Data will be backed up weekly.
Also an alternate cloud backup solution which will back data up weekly, on incremental basis. 
It is possible to lease servers in case Physical Server installation is not possible.

4. Switch to automation, use Cloud Services, Automatic Cloud Deployment, Cloud Backup, setup more Database Servers, Backup servers to meet with the increased demand.
In case of increase in system demands it will be easy to scale up.

3.Question 3

You’re doing systems administration work for Dewgood. Evaluate their current IT infrastructure needs and limitations, then provide at least five process improvements and rationale behind those improvements. Please write a 200-400 word process review for this consultation. Remember, there’s no right or wrong answer, but make sure to provide your reasoning.

Non-profit Company:

Dewgood is a small, local non-profit company of 50 employees. They hired you as the sole IT person in the company. The HR person tells you when they need a new computer for an employee. Currently, computers are purchased directly in a physical store on the day that an employee is hired. This is due to budget reasons, as they can’t keep extra stock in the store.

The company has a single server with multiple services on it, a file server, and email. They don’t currently have a messaging system in place. When a new employee is hired, you have to do an orientation with them for login. You’re also responsible for installing all the software they need on their machine, and mapping the file server to their computer. The computers are managed through Windows Active Directory. When an employee leaves, they’re currently not disabled in the directory service.

The company uses an open-source ticketing system to handle all internal requests as well as external non-profit requests. But the ticketing system is confusing and difficult to use, so lots of the employees reach out to you directly to figure out how to do things. In fact, so many things are difficult to find that employees typically ask around when they have a question.

There are nightly backups in place of the file server. You store this information on a disk backup and take it home with you everyday to keep it safe in case something happens onsite. There’s also a small company website that’s hosted on the single server at the company. This website is a single html page that explains the mission of the company and provides contact information. The website has gone down many times, and no one knows what to do when it happens.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sol.
1. Instead of using a physical computer cloud service can be used on which virtual machines can be installed.
This will be comparatively better than buying a new system each time a new employee joins as it involves a lot of budget and is difficult to manage and keep track of all the systems, but using the cloud virtual machine service it will be easier to manage and also within the budget constraints.  

2. Create separate servers for each services, set up a messaging system and use a automatic software deployment system to install software on to systems. 
Creating separate servers will divide the workload and will be better than having a single server.
Messaging system is needed as it will help convey the messages and there will be no need to do the orientation, only creating the user account and giving the account credentials will be sufficient.
The automated software deployment system will make the task easier to install software on multiple systems, this will save  a lot of time and effort.

3. The ticketing system should either be customized for easier use or make a new ticketing system, it is will be better to teach the employees how to use the ticketing system through sessions and a Handy Manual or Guide needs to be made and issued to the employees on how to use the system.

4. A separate backup server needs to be set up or cloud backup solution should be used and automatic daily backups should be done on incremental basis, this will be very better along with the offsite disk backup as in case the hard drive is lost, stolen or damaged, data will still be backed and since the process is automatic lots of time and effort will be lost.
Keep a backup copy of the website on the backup server or cloud, and in case the website goes down, use the backup server or cloud server  to host the website, while finding the root cause behind the failure and fix it, probably find a permanent solution to it .
